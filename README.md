# Doctor-Assistant UI

This repository contains a UI interface to interact with the server from this [repository](https://github.com/RishabD/DoctorAssistant).

## Setup

This UI uses Vite. Most recent versions of Node should work for running the dev UI and building for production. To be safe, use Node.js version 22.4.0. Run `pnpm i` to install necessary packages. Create a `.env` file and set the environment variables for the ones specified in the `.env.example` file. Run `pnpm dev`, and you should be off to the races.
